    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>How do we access your data?</h3>
    <p>
      No data is collected except for any default data collection by Google.
    </p>
    <h3>How do we use your data?</h3>
    <p>Only aggregate data, if any, is used for analytics.</p>
    <h3>How do we store your data?</h3>
    <p>The only data stored is with Google.</p>
    <h3>How do we share your data?</h3>
    <p>
      We will never transfer, sell, make copies, or share any of your data
      stored by the application to third party services or companies unless
      strictly necessary to enable the application to function properly.
      Accordingly, personal data will be disclosed to third parties on a
      strictly limited 'need to know' basis where there is clear justification
      for transferring Personal Data - either because the Data Subject has
      consented to the transfer or because disclosure is required to perform a
      contract to which the Data Subject is a party, or for a legitimate purpose
      that does not infringe the Data Subject's fundamental rights, including
      the right to privacy (e.g. sharing in the context of a merger and
      acquisition operation).
